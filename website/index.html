                <p>Hello there ! Iâ€™m Maxime Tessier, a novice Game and Narrative Designer but i'll put that aside for now since the videogame industry is going down.<br>

                I've just finished my 3rd year at Eartsup (Bordeaux-France) in a GameDesign course  and i'm starting a master degree at Epitech (Bordeaux-France)<br>
                Therefore i'm gonna need an internship for 32 month to go with it.<br>
                From september to December, we're going the hard way by learning a bit of everything to catch on the actual level we need for the master
                so don't worry, i'll be ready for january !<br> I'm looking forward to work with you and show you how usefull my curiosity and resilience can be :)!

                Always happy to talk about new projects, ideas or just chat, 
                so don't hesitate to reach out !
                </p>
